<h3 align="center"> Large amounts of code? No problem. </h3>

### Introduction
ProtoSYNC allows you to transport large amounts of lua to a secret server to get around the pesky character limit supplied by Roblox's Textbox solution.

### Requirements
This only requires Internet access and Node.js v16.x.x or newer.

Also, Roblox & Roblox Studio installed on your computer.

### Usage

1. Download the master zip of the repository
2. Unzip it, and place it somewhere safe
3. Open a terminal window in the directory that you unzipped
4. Use `npm i` to install the necessary packages (or `express` & `localtunnel` if that doesn't install properly)
5. Run `node protosync` to start ProtoSYNC.

Make sure you copy ProtoSYNC.lua to your Roblox Studio's Plugins Folder.

### Version

This is Version 1 of ProtoSYNC. This branch should not be modified.
